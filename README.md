# craft-vendor-page
This will serve as the initial playground to design templates for single and multiple web-pages to showcase and promote a vendors work at craft and vendor shows.

I'm not sure what kind of disclaimer I need to put here but I don't give anyone rights to anything with this one right now. Not much of this will be useful for most I'd think.

There's 2 styles so I can try and make the page work with iOS 9.3.5 or something... (I'll update this with a better readme when I figure out what I'm doing better. It seems apple makes things difficult if not very different.)
